#  Battleship

**Battleship game made in C with ncurses terminal graphics library** as an assignment for my first semester freshman year of university programming course.

## How to download ncurses
Firstly open your linux terminal and write:

    sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

## How to start the game
I have provided a Makefile with the rules "build", "run" and clean, to create the executable, to run it and to remove the executable. In your linux terminal write:

    make build
    make run
    make clean

Only use "make clean" after you are done with the exec.

## Other files

I have a romanian-written README and the PDF with the requirements written in detail, also in romanian.
